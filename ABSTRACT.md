Weed detection from images has garnered substantial attention from scientific communities in recent years. However, there are only a few available datasets suitable for weed detection from unmanned and other ground vehicles and systems. Addressing mentioned issues, the authors introduce a new dataset named **Carrot-Weed** designed for weed detection under varying light conditions. This dataset comprises RGB images captured from young carrot seedlings throughout the month of February in the vicinity of Negotino, Republic of Macedonia. The authors conducted an initial analysis of the dataset and reported their preliminary findings, achieved through the utilization of convolutional neural network architectures.
