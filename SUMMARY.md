**Weed detection** (Weed detection dataset with RGB images taken under variable light conditions) is a dataset for instance segmentation, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks. It is used in the agriculture industry.

The dataset consists of 39 images with 745 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *weed* and *carrot*.

Each image in the Weed detection dataset has pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds* (39 images). The dataset was released in 2017.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
