**Weed Detection Dataset with RGB Images Taken under Variable Light Conditions** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the agricultural research. 

The dataset consists of 39 images with 745 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *weed* and *carrot*.

Images in the Weed Detection dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2017 by the University of Sts. Cyril and Methodius in Skopje, Macedonia.

Here is the visualized example grid with animated annotations:
