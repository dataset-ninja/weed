**Sweet Pepper** (Sweet Pepper and Peduncle Segmentation) is a dataset for semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the agriculture industry.

The dataset consists of 620 images with 6422 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*pepper*).

Each image in the Sweet Pepper dataset has pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 1 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 1 splits in the dataset: *ds* (620 images). The dataset was released in 2022.

Here is the visualized example of the single pepper class:
